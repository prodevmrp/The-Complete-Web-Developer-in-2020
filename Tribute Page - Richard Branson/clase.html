                He is a born leader who tries to listen and satisfy the needs of employees and clients.
                “One thing is for sure in business: you and everyone around you will make mistakes. When you are pushing the limits, this is inevitable, but it is important to recognize this. We trust that people learn from mistakes; recriminations are useless. "
                claiming that "an unhappy employee can ruin the brand experience, and if a person spends 80% of their life working," why wait to get home for fun? ".
                "Train people well enough that they can leave, treat them well enough that they want to stay."
                "One of the key attributes of being a good leader is listening, and most importantly, making sure you act on that feedback."
